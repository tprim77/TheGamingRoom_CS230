# TheGamingRoom_CS230

<b> Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? </b>
<br> The Gaming Room is a company that wants to expand their currently existing game on Android to other operating systems. They wanted everything to work together so they can expand to a broader audience.

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>
<br I feel that I did the evaluation chart very well. It shows many of the good and bad reasons to on why you would choose one operating system over another. I have already looked back on it a few times and will probably continue to use it in the future to help me when deciding what platform to create new applicaitons for.

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
<br> The design constraints and domain model sections were helpful to developing the code. The UML diagram was especially helpful as it basically shows how to set up all the code very easily.


<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
<br> I would probably choose to revise a little bit of the recommendations section. The information I have within is good, but I could have been a little more descriptive with sources to support my recommendations.

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
<br> I did not have to think too much about the user's needs because I mostly assumed the preexisting application had already taken care of most of the user issues. I still think it is important to make the interface easy to understand and use. The user is the reason the application is being made so ultimately they should be the ones prioritized in development.

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
<br> I approached designing the software in smaller sections to fully build the software. I also slowly was learning more and more as time went on to fully be able to understand why each section needed specific interest, like the server side and client side. I now know for the future that things like serverless is an option to host an application and I know the specifics of each operating system to better develop applications to their strengths. Designing a similar application would lead me to side with Linux as the OS and most likely picking a serverless option which would make designing the application much easier.
